//RULES:

//Split Under 21 Rule
//Modified split: If either of the player's hand 
//in a split beats dealer, player wins bet on both hands automatically
//But if Player busts on either deck, Dealer wins bet on both decks.
//If player's first hand has a standoff with dealer, player's other hand
//must beat dealer, otherwise dealer wins
//If player's second hand stands off with dealer,
//player gets original bet back

//Player can either double down or split, player cannot split
//then double down and vice versa
